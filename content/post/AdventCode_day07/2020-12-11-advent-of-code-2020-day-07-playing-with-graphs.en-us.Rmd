In this post, we explore the day 7 puzzles of the Advent Of Code 2020 using network analysis through `tidygraph` package, allowing us generate a simple, direct and small code to solve them.

<!--more-->

This post continues the [Advent Of Code 2020 series](/2020/12/advent-of-code-2020-part_02/) an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. In this post, we explore the characteristics of day 7 puzzles to explore the use of  [Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) in R. Interpreting the _bag regulations_ as a _network_ we are capable to solve the puzzles with simple few lines of code.

## Day 7: Handy Haversacks

### Part One

You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to issues in luggage processing.

Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!

For example, consider the following rules:

```
light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
faded blue bags contain no other bags.
dotted black bags contain no other bags.
```


These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every faded blue bag is empty, every vibrant plum bag contains 11 bags (5 faded blue and 6 dotted black), and so on.

You have a `shiny gold bag`. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least `one shiny gold bag`?)

In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:

```
A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.
A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.
A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
```

So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag is 4.

#### The graph approach

Before try to resolve the puzzle directly, let's try with the test scenario above. To do so, we can interpret the _bag regulations_ as a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) of relationships where `one bag type+color` can contains `N bags of other type+color` and each one, by itself, can have others bags accordingly to the rules. 

Once we build the network we can "navigate" thought it from a starting point (_our bag is shiny gold_) and see where the path goes to get which type of bag can contain at least one shiny gold.

First, let's interpret the _bag regulations_ into a data frame of `bag type+color -> N bags type_color` contains rules.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# reads the input as a vector of strings
input <- readLines("./day07_test_01.txt")

# function to decode the string bag rules in a tibble
decodeBagRules <- function(.input){
  tibble(input=.input) %>% 
  # separates the bag from the content rule
  separate(input, into=c("bag","contains"), sep=" contain ") %>% 
  # for each back split the rule in different types of bag
  # we build a 'tidy' dataset, each line maps from a bag to a content
  group_by(bag) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate( contains =  map(data,~unlist(str_split(.x,", "))) ) %>% 
  unnest(contains) %>% 
  select(-data) %>% 
  # now we split the bag type and color 
  separate(bag, into = c("bag.type","bag.color"), sep = " ", extra = "drop") %>%
  # also for the content rule
  separate(contains, into = c("ctn.bag.qtd","ctn.bag.type","ctn.bag.color"), sep=" ", extra = "drop") %>% 
  # some adjust to bags with no content
  mutate( ctn.bag.qtd = if_else(ctn.bag.qtd=="no","0",ctn.bag.qtd) ) %>% 
  mutate( ctn.bag.qtd = as.integer(ctn.bag.qtd), 
          ctn.bag.type = if_else( ctn.bag.qtd==0, as.character(NA), ctn.bag.type),
          ctn.bag.color = if_else( ctn.bag.qtd==0, as.character(NA), ctn.bag.color) )
}

# transforms the strings in a data frame with the rules
bag.rules <- decodeBagRules(input)

# let's see what we have
bag.rules %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)
```

Now, with the role in this format, let's try to build (and visualize) the relationship network. We'll use the [`tidygraph` package](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/).

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidygraph)

# we build a graph, first create a "from->to" edge list
# In this part one we want to find with bag can contains a specific type+color bag
# so we create a network 'contains' -> 'bag'
bag.graph <- bag.rules %>% 
  transmute( from = paste0(ctn.bag.type,"_",ctn.bag.color),
             to = paste0(bag.type,"_",bag.color),
             n = ctn.bag.qtd) %>% 
  # remove bags with no content
  filter(n!=0) %>% 
  # keep the capacity (as weight) and directed
  as_tbl_graph(bag.graph, directed = T)

# what we have?
bag.graph

```

We can see the network using `ggraph` package.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggraph)

# auxiliary function to ggplot a graph
plotGraph <- function(.g){
  
  # plot it
  .g %>% 
    ggraph(layout = "kk") +
      geom_edge_fan(aes(label=n), alpha=0.5, arrow = arrow(type="closed", angle=10, length = unit(5,units = "mm") ))+
      geom_node_point(alpha=0.7, size=8, color="navy") +
      geom_node_text(aes(label=name), color="black") +
      theme_void()

}

plotGraph(bag.graph)


```

So, we can see our network, built to represent which bag (type+color) (_a node_) can be stored (_an edge_) inside other (_a node_). To find the puzzle So, finally, it's easy ask to the network with paths are possible starting from the node `shiny gold`, it's a similar to ask what are the nodes we can reach starting from node `shiny_gold`? The function `all_simple_paths` from `igraph` package do the job.

```{r fig.width=2, fig.height=2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)

# we query the graph asking for all paths from the "shiny_old" node
paths <- bag.graph %>% 
  all_simple_paths(from="shiny_gold") 

# this function returns a list of nodes of all simple paths
# Let's see
paths 
  

```

The puzzle is ask for *how many bags* can contain an `shiny_gold` bag, the answer is simple, we look the end of each possible path starting from node `shiny_gold` and count the unique bags.

```{r}

# we query the graph asking for all paths from the "shiny_old" node
bag.graph %>% 
  all_simple_paths(from="shiny_gold") %>% 
  # get only the "end" node of each path
  map_chr(~names(tail(.x,1))) %>% 
  unique() %T>%
  # what are?
  print() %>% 
  # counts it
  length()

```

As you see, we got the correct number.

#### Puzzle's Sollution

How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag? (The list of rules is quite long; make sure you get all of it.). Let's apply the same strategy.

```{r}
# reads the input as a vector of strings
input <- readLines("./day07_input.txt")

# transforms the strings in a data frame with the rules
bag.rules <- decodeBagRules(input)

# we build a graph, first create a "from->to" edge list
# In this part one we want to find with bag can contains a specific type+color bag
# so we create a network 'contains' -> 'bag'
bag.graph <- bag.rules %>% 
  transmute( from = paste0(ctn.bag.type,"_",ctn.bag.color),
             to = paste0(bag.type,"_",bag.color),
             n = ctn.bag.qtd) %>% 
  # remove bags with no content
  filter(n!=0) %>% 
  # keep the capacity (as weight) and directed
  as_tbl_graph(bag.graph, directed = T)

# we query the graph asking for all paths from the "shiny_old" node
bag.graph %>% 
  all_simple_paths(from="shiny_gold") %>% 
  # get only the "end" node of each path
  map_chr(~names(tail(.x,1))) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  # counts it
  length()


```
--- Part Two ---

It's getting pretty expensive to fly these days - not because of ticket prices, but because of the ridiculous number of bags you need to buy!

Consider again your shiny gold bag and the rules from the above example:

```
faded blue bags contain 0 other bags.
dotted black bags contain 0 other bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 11 other bags: 5 faded blue bags and 6 dotted black bags.
dark olive bags contain 7 other bags: 3 faded blue bags and 4 dotted black bags.
```

So, a single shiny gold bag must contain 1 dark olive bag (and the 7 bags within it) plus 2 vibrant plum bags (and the 11 bags within each of those): 1 + 1*7 + 2 + 2*11 = 32 bags!

Of course, the actual rules have a small chance of going several levels deeper than this example; be sure to count all of the bags, even if the nesting becomes topologically impractical!

Here's another example:

```
shiny gold bags contain 2 dark red bags.
dark red bags contain 2 dark orange bags.
dark orange bags contain 2 dark yellow bags.
dark yellow bags contain 2 dark green bags.
dark green bags contain 2 dark blue bags.
dark blue bags contain 2 dark violet bags.
dark violet bags contain no other bags.
```

In this example, a single shiny gold bag must contain 126 other bags.

How many individual bags are required inside your single shiny gold bag?

#### The Graph Approach

It's the same here, we can build a network to follow the "contains" path this time, and explore the path starting from `shiny_gold` nodes, but we are interesting in the `edges` of the path, that inform us about the number of the bags. Let's do this in the test case above.


```{r message=FALSE, warnign=F}

# reads the input as a vector of strings
input <- readLines("./day07_test_02.txt")

bag.rules <- decodeBagRules(input)

# transforms the bag rules into a graph from bag to contains
bag.graph <- bag.rules %>% 
  transmute( from = paste0(bag.type,"_",bag.color),
             to = paste0(ctn.bag.type,"_",ctn.bag.color),
             n = ctn.bag.qtd ) %>% # we keep the number of bags here !!
  # remove bags that not contains any bag
  filter(n!=0) %>% 
  # keep the capacity (as n) and directed
  as_tbl_graph(bag.graph, directed = T)

# Let's see?
# it's a simple chain
plotGraph(bag.graph)

# finds all paths starting 
paths <- bag.graph %>% 
  all_simple_paths(from = "shiny_gold")

# for each path 
paths %>% 
  map_dbl(function(.p,.g){
    # get the subgraph, 
    to_subgraph(.g, name %in% names(.p)) %>%
      .[[1]] %E>%
        # get the edges
        as_tibble() %>%
        # get the capacity (n)
        .$n %>%
        # multiply then to find the
        # sequence storage capacity
        prod()
    }, .g=bag.graph) %>% 
  # finally, sum the capacity of the paths
  sum()

```
We got the correct answer, so we replicate this to the input data.

```{r message=FALSE, warnign=F}
# reads the input as a vector of strings
input <- readLines("./day07_input.txt")

bag.rules <- decodeBagRules(input)

# transforms the bag rules into a graph from bag to contains
bag.graph <- bag.rules %>% 
  transmute( from = paste0(bag.type,"_",bag.color),
             to = paste0(ctn.bag.type,"_",ctn.bag.color),
             n = ctn.bag.qtd ) %>% # we keep the number of bags here !!
  # remove bags that not contains any bag
  filter(n!=0) %>% 
  # keep the capacity (as n) and directed
  as_tbl_graph(bag.graph, directed = T)

# finds all paths starting 
paths <- bag.graph %>% 
  all_simple_paths(from = "shiny_gold")

# for each path 
paths %>% 
  map_dbl(function(.p,.g){
    # get the subgraph, 
    to_subgraph(.g, name %in% names(.p)) %>%
      .[[1]] %E>%
        # get the edges
        as_tibble() %>%
        # get the capacity (n)
        .$n %>%
        # multiply then to find the
        # sequence storage capacity
        prod()
    }, .g=bag.graph) %>% 
  # finally, sum the capacity of the paths
  sum()

```

And that's it! All possible combinations of bag starting from a `shiny_gold` bag in accordance with the _bag regulations_.

## To be continued…

I’ll make the rest of puzzles in the next days and publish them here, see you!
