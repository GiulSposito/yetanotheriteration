We learn from the masters, doing the *math* by ourselves, so, in this post we reproduce two data analysis from David Robinson's *#TidyTuesday* screencasts, the first one about the horro movie ratings dataset where he uses a lasso regression to predict the ratings of a movie based on genre, cast and plot. The second is about a dataset of pizza ratings in NYC and other cities. There are goods data handling tricks using tidyverse in these analysis.

## Horror Movies

Under the halloween influence, we just reproduce the analysis of the [IMDB¬¥s](https://www.imdb.com/) [Horror Movie Dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-22) made by [David Robinson's](https://twitter.com/drob) in one of famous screen cast. The dataset is available in the [#TidyTuesday GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

### Data loading and cleaning

```{r loadData}
# basic setup
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr) # for kable
library(kableExtra) # to change tables font size
theme_set(theme_minimal()) # changing ggplot2 default theme

# data load
horror_movies_raw <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-22/horror_movies.csv")

glimpse(horror_movies_raw)
```

We see here, besides a `release_date` attribute, there is also a *year* information inside the `title` field, let's extract this data into a new `year` column. Also, we have to correctly parsing the `budget` column. Note that the `plot` column also has a strange content.

```{r plotField}
horror_movies_raw[1,]$plot
```

It starts with the director of the movie, the cast and only after that the movie plot, we need to split these infos in diferent columns.

```{r dataCleaning}
# some data cleaning
horror_movies <- horror_movies_raw %>% 
  arrange(desc(review_rating)) %>% 
  # remove the "year" from title and put into a "year" column
  extract(title, "year", "\\((\\d\\d\\d\\d)\\)$", remove = F, convert = T) %>% 
  # using "parse_number" to correctly the buget column
  mutate(budget=parse_number(budget)) %>% 
  # Splitting the "plot" info. We split each sentence in diferent columns.
  # First one to the director, one for the actors and the remaings to the "plot"
  separate(plot, c("director","cast_sentence","plot"), sep="\\. ", extra="merge", fill="right") %>% 
  distinct(title, .keep_all = T)
```

Some *tidy functions* were pretty handy in this manipulation, worth to check the documentation and know how to use [`tidyr::extract()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/extract.html),  [`tidyr::separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html) and [`readr::parse_number()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.3.1/topics/parse_number).

### Exploring the data

Let's see some aspects of the dataset

```{r basicEDA}
# how much movies by genres?
horror_movies %>% 
  count(genres, sort=T) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kable()

# by language
horror_movies %>% 
  count(language, sort=T) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kable()

# how is the bugdet distribution
horror_movies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(budget)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10(labels=scales::dollar)
```

One of the things I didn't know was how to format the datatype in the chart axis, in the screencast David uses the function `scales::dollar()` to transform the X axis in *money*. The package [`Scales`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/scales/versions/0.2.0) map data to aesthetics, and provide methods for automatically determining breaks and labels for axs and legends, pretty handy,

Do higher budget movies end up higher rated?

```{r budget_x_rating}
# plot budget x rating
horror_movies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(budget, review_rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels=scales::dollar) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

No relationshiop between budget and rating. How about `movie rating` (classification of film's suitability for certain audiences based on its content) and the `movie review` (people's movie evaluation)?

```{r ratinge_x_review}
# let's look movie_rating x review_rating
horror_movies %>% 
  mutate( movie_rating = fct_lump(movie_rating, 5),
          movie_rating = fct_reorder(movie_rating, review_rating, na.rm=T)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(movie_rating, review_rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

Two [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) functions were util here, the [`fct_lump()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_lump.html) used to collapse the least frequent values of a factor into ‚Äúother‚Äù and [`fct_reorder()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_reorder.html) to reorder the factor `movie_rating` by another variable, in this case, the median (default function) of `movie_rating` itself. Doing this we can put the `movie_rating` in order on the chart.

Seems that there is a relationship between `movie_review` and `movie_rating`, how much?

```{r movie_x_review_anova}
# Calculates the "anova" of Linear Regration between Rating and Review
horror_movies %>% 
  filter(!is.na(movie_rating)) %>% 
  mutate( movie_rating = fct_lump(movie_rating, 5) ) %>% 
  lm(review_rating ~ movie_rating, data=.) %>% 
  anova()
```

Let's plot this in a better way.

```{r movie_x_review_better_plot}
# plotting the mean and standard deviation of movie reviews
# for each movie rating
horror_movies %>% 
  filter(!is.na(movie_rating)) %>% 
  mutate( movie_rating = fct_lump(movie_rating, 5),
          movie_rating = fct_reorder(movie_rating, review_rating, na.rm=T) ) %>% 
  group_by(movie_rating) %>% 
  summarise(
    review_rating_mean = mean(review_rating, na.rm=T),
    review_rating_var  = var(review_rating, na.rm=T),
    review_rating_sd   = sd(review_rating, na.rm=T),
    review_rating_error = sqrt(review_rating_var/length(review_rating))
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(movie_rating, review_rating_mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=review_rating_mean-review_rating_error, ymax=review_rating_mean+review_rating_error)) 
```

Is there genres better evaluated than others?

```{r}
horror_movies %>% 
  separate_rows(genres,sep="\\| ") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(genres)) %>% 
  mutate( genres = fct_lump(genres, 5)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(genres, review_rating)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

There some preferences, but not too much difference.

### Textual Analysis

Let's explore the `plot` field throught text analysis. Is there any word that influences the `review_rating`?

```{r wordReview}
library(tidytext) # to tokenize the plot text

# tokenize
horror_movies_unnested <- horror_movies %>% 
  # split tokens
  unnest_tokens(word, plot) %>% 
  # remove meaningless words
  anti_join(stop_words, by="word") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(word))

# lets check
horror_movies_unnested %>% 
  count(word, sort=T) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kable()

```

Visualizing `word` and the average of `review_rating`.

```{r word_x_avg_rating}

# Visualizing word and the average of review_rating
horror_movies_unnested %>% 
  filter(!is.na(review_rating)) %>% 
  group_by(word) %>% 
  # by word, count and mean the review_rating
  summarise(
    movies=n(),
    avg_rating = mean(review_rating)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(movies)) %>% 
  # words that appears in the plot of 100 or more movies only
  filter(movies>=100) %>%
  mutate(word=fct_reorder(word, avg_rating)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(avg_rating, word)) +
  geom_point()

```

### Lasso Regression for Predicting Review Rating on Words

Lasso stands for **Least Absolute Shrinkage Selector Operator**, it is a type of regression that allow you to regularize ("shrink") coefficients. This means that the estimated coefficients are pushed towards 0, to make them work better on new data-sets ("optimized for prediction"). This allows you to use complex models and avoid over-fitting at the same time.

You can learn details of this regressions on:

- [Regularization: Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-ridge-lasso-elastic-net) @ Datacamp

```{r firstLasso}
library(glmnet) # lasso
library(Matrix) # to handle sparse matrixes

# word sparse matrix
movie_word_matrix <- horror_movies_unnested %>% 
  filter(!is.na(review_rating)) %>% 
  add_count(word) %>% 
  # palavras que apareceram pelo menos 20 vezes
  filter(n>=20) %>% 
  count(title, word) %>% 
  # sparse matrix
  cast_sparse(title, word, n)

# let's see how many words are
dim(movie_word_matrix)

# indexing review_rating by the word in the sparse matrix
rating <- horror_movies$review_rating[match(rownames(movie_word_matrix), horror_movies$title)]

# fitting the LASSO model
lasso_model <- cv.glmnet(movie_word_matrix, rating)
```

Let's see the characteristics of the fitted model.

```{r checkingTheModel}
library(broom)

# lets see how the coeficient shrink for some "popular" terms
# conform the "lambda" term rises
tidy(lasso_model$glmnet.fit) %>% 
  filter(term %in% c("friends","evil", "college", "haunted", "mother", "life",
                     "woods","discover","abandoned", "woods")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lambda, estimate, color=term)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty=2)

# we are able to visualize the CV performance 
# in function of lambda parameter
plot(lasso_model)

# the model give us the lambda for optimal performance
# (min square feet error)
log(lasso_model$lambda.min)

# at that lambda level, let's see how each term
# weighted in the model
tidy(lasso_model$glmnet.fit) %>% 
  filter(lambda==lasso_model$lambda.min, 
         term != "(Intercept)") %>% 
  mutate( term = fct_reorder(term, estimate) ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(term, estimate)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

```
