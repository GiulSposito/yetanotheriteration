It's just a place to put my ideas and thoughts on the topics that I like and I get involved in everyday life, especially about software development, agility, lean production and data science.

The same blog is an experience with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (my current favorite language), created using pages written in [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and converted to a site using [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), versioned in [GitHub](https://github.com/GiulSposito/yetanotheriteration) and published in [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com).
