It's just a place to put my ideas and thoughts on the topics that I like and I get involved in everyday life, especially about software development, agility, lean production and data science.

[Yihui Xie](http://www.twitter.com/), one of the [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package authors tells that we should write a blog to ourselves, we write to us in the future, that writing something makes it more clear. I agree with the last part.

And we don't have to bother about the quality of every post, because we'll wrote a lot of crap text, but in the middle of that we can find a pearl once in while, and that post will teach something to someone, and the blog will worth. 

I've learning a lot about R and Data Science, reading other's blog, I think that is time to share some too, maybe I make someone's life easly.

The blog itself is an experience with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (my current favorite language), created using pages written in [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and converted to a site using [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), versioned in [GitHub](https://github.com/GiulSposito/yetanotheriteration) and published in [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com).

Hope you enjoy and have fun!
