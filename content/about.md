## Giuliano Sposito

### Myself

[Computer Engineer](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/ensino/graduacao/cursos/ec) and Master in [Strategic Management of Technological Innovation](http://www.extecamp.unicamp.br/gestaodainovacao/), both by [Unicamp](http://www.unicamp.br), and with a specialization in Data Science. Senior Manager at [CI&T](http://www.ciandt.com), current working as Lean Digital Consulting.

### My Job

Innovation is now everyone's business. If you are a manager in a global company, an entrepreneur starting your business, a team leader, or even a developer within a development team, it is expected that you do more and better with fewer resources (Get Lean!). My job as a Lean Process Specialist in development and innovation is to help [CI&T](http://www.ciandt.com) customers cross the path to The Agile Transformation, optimizing their development processes and incorporating aspects of innovation and continuous improvement.

### This Blog

It's just a place to put my ideas and thoughts on the topics that I like and I get involved in everyday life, especially about software development, agility, lean production and data science.

The blog itself is an experience with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (my current favorite language), created using pages written in [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and converted to a site using [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), versioned in [GitHub](https://github.com/GiulSposito/yetanotheriteration) and published in [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com).
