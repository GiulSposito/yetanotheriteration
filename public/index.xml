      <description>Collinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables collinearity are closely related to one another. The presence of collinearity can pose problems in the regression context, since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear variables on the response.
This R Notebook seeks to ilustrate some of the difficulties that can be result from a collinearity.</description>

      <description>In this RNotebook we’ll read a TCX and GPX files, used to track physical training and exercises evolving GPS and paths used by some workout Mobile Apps and Devices. Particularly we’ll will process one TCX file containing a MTB ride mine and transforming the a useful R data.frame ploting the ride track over a map.
Tracking Files1There are two popular file format to track workouts and routes through GPS devices: GPX and TCX.</description>

      <title>Curse of Dimensionality</title>

      <description>This R Notebook reproduces the Curse of Dimensionality1 in the nearest neighbor regression that here is defined as the increasing of the interval size to get 10% of the data acording with the increasing of dimentions. So according more dimensions are add to the domain, greater is the size of the range to get the same proportion of data points. Conforming we increase the size of the range we lost “locality” of the information, losing the capacity to resume the information with a simple average.</description>

      <title>Assessing Model Accuracy (Linear Models)</title>

      <description>This post talks about the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) against the flexibility of a function fitted as a technique to assess the model accuracy in a specific problem as describe in the An Introduction to Statistical Learning in R book.
Measure the quality of fit (regression problems)In order to evaluate the performance of a statistical learning method on a given data set, we need some way to measure how well its predictions actually match the observed data.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s just a place to put my ideas and thoughts on the topics that I like and I get involved in everyday life, especially about software development, agility, lean production and data science.
When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function
When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post
&amp;mdash; David Robinson (@drob) November 9, 2017  Yihui Xie, one of the Blogdown package authors tells that we should write a blog to ourselves, we write to us in the future, that writing something makes it more clear.</description>
