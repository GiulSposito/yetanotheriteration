      <description>The football season is back, and with it the Fantasy Game! In this post, we will simulate the results and the scoring of my Fantasy League games. To do that, we’ll project the scoring of teams using Monte Carlo simulation with data scraped from sites that predicts players’ performances. We will combine the various possible scores of a team’s players to estimate the team’s score distribution, and then compare with the opposing team, and finally compute each team’s chances of winning and losing.</description>

      <title>Using Facebook&#39;s Prophet to forecast my weight loss</title>

      <description>In this post, we’ll try to forecast my weight using Forecast and Facebook’s Prophet packages. We’ll see what is the performance from Facebook’s method in a simple case of forecast.
Recently, in the beginning of march, I went to a Nutritionist who recommended me to start a regime to lost some weight. As a good practice in these situations, short feedback cycles are essential to (re)build good habits, so I start to weigh myself almost daily, and record the values in a spreadsheet to follow my progress.</description>

      <title>kNN Analysis on MNIST with 97% accuracy</title>

      <description>Usually Yann LeCun’s MNIST database is used to explore Artificial Neural Network architectures for image recognition problem.
In the last post the use of a ANN (LeNet architecture) implemented using mxnet to resolve this classification problem.
But in this post, we’ll see that the MNIST problem isn’t a difficult one, only resolved by ANNs, analyzing the data set we can see that is possible, with a high degree of precision, resolving this classification problem with a simple k-nearest neighbors algorithm.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html&#34;&gt;R Notebook&lt;/a&gt; I implement an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network&#34;&gt;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/&#34;&gt;MNIST Database&lt;/a&gt; for handwritten digits recognition using &lt;a href=&#34;http://mxnet.io/&#34;&gt;mxnet&lt;/a&gt; framework for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In this quick post, we’ll take one MTB ride, tracked by FitBit in a TXC File, and generate a animated gif. Using gganimate Package and using the same code we learned, we can animate the map with few words.
Reading TCX FileWe already saw to how read and GPS track information stored in a TXC/GPX file, once it’s just an XML File.

      <title>High Collinearity Effect in Regressions</title>
      <link>/2018/01/high-collinearity-effect-in-regressions/</link>

      <guid>/2018/01/high-collinearity-effect-in-regressions/</guid>
      <description>Collinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables collinearity are closely related to one another. The presence of collinearity can pose problems in the regression context, since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear variables on the response.
This R Notebook seeks to ilustrate some of the difficulties that can be result from a collinearity.</description>

      <description>In this RNotebook we’ll read a TCX and GPX files, used to track physical training and exercises evolving GPS and paths used by some workout Mobile Apps and Devices. Particularly we’ll will process one TCX file containing a MTB ride mine and transforming the a useful R data.frame ploting the ride track over a map.
Tracking Files1There are two popular file format to track workouts and routes through GPS devices: GPX and TCX.</description>

      <title>Curse of Dimensionality</title>

      <description>This R Notebook reproduces the Curse of Dimensionality1 in the nearest neighbor regression that here is defined as the increasing of the interval size to get 10% of the data acording with the increasing of dimentions. So according more dimensions are add to the domain, greater is the size of the range to get the same proportion of data points. Conforming we increase the size of the range we lost “locality” of the information, losing the capacity to resume the information with a simple average.</description>

      <title>Assessing Model Accuracy (Linear Models)</title>

      <guid>/2018/01/assessing-model-accuracy-linear-modelsrmd/</guid>
      <description>This post talks about the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) against the flexibility of a function fitted as a technique to assess the model accuracy in a specific problem as describe in the An Introduction to Statistical Learning in R book.
Measure the quality of fit (regression problems)In order to evaluate the performance of a statistical learning method on a given data set, we need some way to measure how well its predictions actually match the observed data.</description>
