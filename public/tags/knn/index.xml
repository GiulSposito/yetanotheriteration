      <description>Usually Yann LeCun’s MNIST database is used to explore Artificial Neural Network architectures for image recognition problem.
In the last post the use of a ANN (LeNet architecture) implemented using mxnet to resolve this classification problem.
But in this post, we’ll see that the MNIST problem isn’t a difficult one, only resolved by ANNs, analyzing the data set we can see that is possible, with a high degree of precision, resolving this classification problem with a simple k-nearest neighbors algorithm.</description>
