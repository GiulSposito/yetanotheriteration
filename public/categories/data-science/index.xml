      <description>This post talks about the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) against the flexibility of a function fitted as a technique to assess the model accuracy in a specific problem as describe in the An Introduction to Statistical Learning in R book.
Measure the quality of fit (regression problems)In order to evaluate the performance of a statistical learning method on a given data set, we need some way to measure how well its predictions actually match the observed data.</description>
